    "# Normalization Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Lowercasing**\n",
    "\n",
    "- What it does:\n",
    "    - Convert all characters in your text to lowercase (e.g., “The Quick Brown Fox” → “the quick brown fox”).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why it helps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Vocabulary reduction: “Dog,” “dog,” and “DOG” all become “dog,” so your model learns fewer, more robust word forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Consistency: Downstream tokenizers and embeddings treat words uniformly, improving statistics (e.g., word counts, TF–IDF).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Remove URLs**\n",
    "- What it does:\n",
    "    - Strip out web addresses (e.g., “https://example.com/page”). Typically done via a regex like https?://\\S+ or <http\\S+>.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why it helps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Reduce noise: URLs rarely contain linguistically meaningful content for most tasks (unless you’re doing specialized link analysis).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Prevent data leakage: Raw URLs can embed user-specific or sensitive information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Remove Numbers**\n",
    "- What it does:\n",
    "    - Delete or replace digit sequences (e.g., “In 2025, sales hit 1,000” → “In , sales hit ,”). Often achieved with a regex like \\d+.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why it helps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Normalize quantities: Unless your task needs exact numeric values (e.g., financial forecasting), stripping numbers keeps focus on the textual patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Vocabulary control: Prevents proliferation of unique “words” like “2025,” “2024,” etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Remove Punctuation**\n",
    "- What it does:\n",
    "    - Strip punctuation marks (.,!?;:“”()-—…) from the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why it helps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Cleaner tokens: Ensures “hello,” “hello!” and “hello?” all map to “hello.”\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Simplify modeling: Many algorithms treat punctuation as separate tokens, which often adds little semantic value in typical text classification or topic modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Remove Stop Words**\n",
    "- What it does:\n",
    "    - Eliminate very frequent, semantically-light words like “the,” “is,” “and,” “of.” Common stop‑word lists include 100–300 words.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why it helps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Focus on content words: Drops words that carry little topic or sentiment information.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Dimensionality reduction: Fewer tokens → smaller vocabulary → faster training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Lemmatization**\n",
    "- What it does:\n",
    "    - Reduce words to their dictionary (lemma) form, taking context and part-of-speech into account (e.g., “running” → “run,” “better” → “good”).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why it helps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Semantic grouping: “run,” “runs,” “running,” “ran” all become “run,” so your model sees them as the same concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Improved generalization: Helps with sparsity, especially in smaller datasets.\n",

    "# Transform text data into features\n",
    "- Maps the Sentiments into (positive:1, negative:0)\n",
    "\n",
    "- We are using scikit‑learn’s `CountVectorizer` to turn a column of raw text (“reviews”) into a numeric feature matrix. Let’s break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`CountVectorizer(max_features=max_features)`**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **What it is:** A transformer that converts a collection of text documents into a “bag‑of‑words” count matrix.\n",
    "   * **`max_features` parameter:** Limits the vocabulary to the top `max_features` most frequent tokens across your entire corpus. This helps control dimensionality by discarding all but the most common words.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`.fit_transform(df['review'])`**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **`fit`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Learns the vocabulary dictionary: it scans all the reviews, tokenizes them (by default on whitespace and punctuation), counts word frequencies, and selects the top `max_features` words to keep.\n",
    "   * **`transform`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Converts each review into a vector of word counts, where each dimension corresponds to one of the selected vocabulary words.\n",
    "   * **Combining them (`fit_transform`):**\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Efficiently does both steps in one go: first it “fits” to build the vocabulary, then immediately “transforms” the input text into the count matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Result `X`**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * A **sparse matrix** of shape `(n_samples, max_features)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "     * **`n_samples`** = number of rows in `df['review']`.\n",
    "     * **`max_features`** = number of columns (the size of your truncated vocabulary).\n",
    "   * Each row is a document (one review); each column is a token (one of the top `max_features` words).\n",
    "   * The entries are integer counts: how many times each word appears in that review.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use this?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Numerical input for ML models:** Most classical algorithms (logistic regression, SVMs, random forests, etc.) expect numeric arrays, not raw text.\n",
    "* **Dimensionality control:** By capping at `max_features`, you avoid extremely high‑dimensional matrices that blow up memory and overfit on rare words.\n",
    "* **Baseline representation:** Bag‑of‑words is a simple yet surprisingly effective way to capture word‑frequency information as features.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df['review'] = [\n",
    "    \"I loved the movie, it was fantastic!\",\n",
    "    \"Terrible acting and boring plot.\",\n",
    "    \"Fantastic visuals but boring story.\"\n",
    "]\n",
    "max_features = 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After fitting, `CountVectorizer` might pick these top 5 words:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "['boring', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'story', 'terrible']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then `X.toarray()` would look something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "array([\n",
    "  [0, 1, 1, 0, 0],   # \"loved the movie fantastic\" → counts: boring=0, fantastic=1, movie=1, ...\n",
